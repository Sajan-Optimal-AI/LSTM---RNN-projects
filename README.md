# About the data:
               1.Data can be held from : https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data#
               2.In kaggle website data is available in the form of three categories i.e submit , test , train.But for the work, train dataset is only taken.
               3.Dataset carries information about newses in brief with the details of editor and news source.And also label column has been included in binary form.

# Step by step implementation:
                      1.Text screening and preprocessing (Word Embedding)
                      2.Split the data and define the model (LSTM)
                      3.Evalaute the model
                      4.Diagnose curves observation
                      5.SHyper parameter tuning
                    
# Inspiration and idea to the code generation is taken from Krish Naik (Youtuber) and Jason Brownlee(MachinelearningMastery blog).
